# bingewatcher-cpp

same old [bingewatcher](https://github/nimaaskarian/bingewatcher), but instead of python, written in cpp.
## better code base.
the code base is just better, its using OOP model, but don't sacrifice performance over anything. (and cpp is more fun than python to code).

## better performance
its written in a low level compiler language, no s*** its gonna have better performance! but its around 10-15 times faster than the python version... so yeah
